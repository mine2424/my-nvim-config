```

### IDE Management
- **Start IDE**: `<leader>is` or `:StartSimpleIDE` (auto-starts on empty Neovim)
- **Window Navigation**: 
  - `<leader>w1` - Jump to file tree
  - `<leader>w2` - Jump to main editor
  - `<leader>w3` - Jump to secondary editor
- **Window Management**:
  - `<leader>w=` - Rebalance windows (keeps file tree at 30 columns)
  - `<leader>wd` - Duplicate current buffer to right window
- **Quick Exit**:
  - `<leader>qq` - Exit all windows and quit Neovim
  - `<leader>qa` - Force quit without saving
  - `<leader>wqa` - Save all and quit

## Development Commands

### Setup and Installation
```bash
# Default setup (config files only - safe default)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Full automated setup (includes all components with MCP fix)
# Note: This now includes Rust/cargo for building avante.nvim
./scripts/setup.sh --full

# Component-specific setup
./scripts/setup.sh pnpm-only      # pnpm only
./scripts/setup.sh starship-only  # Starship only
./scripts/setup.sh config-only    # Config files only (same as default)
./scripts/setup.sh quick          # Quick setup (configs only)
./scripts/setup.sh mcp-only       # Install MCP servers with automatic fix
./scripts/setup.sh mcp-fix        # Fix MCP server connections
./scripts/setup.sh serena-only    # Install Serena MCP only
./scripts/setup.sh kiro-only      # Install Kiro command only

- `claude/serena_project_template.yml` - Template for project-specific Serena configuration
- `scripts/mcp.sh` - Adaptive MCP setup script with intelligent path detection
- `scripts/setup-serena.sh` - Serena MCP specific setup script

### MCP Setup
The adaptive MCP configuration is automatically installed with the main setup script and configures MCP servers in Claude Code **user settings** (global scope) by default:

```bash
# Automatic MCP setup with user scope (global settings)
./scripts/setup.sh --full       # Full setup (includes MCP with user scope)
./scripts/setup.sh mcp-only     # Install and fix MCP servers in user settings
./scripts/setup.sh mcp-fix      # Fix existing MCP connections in user settings

# Direct MCP management with scope control
./scripts/mcp.sh --fix --no-test --user   # Configure in user settings (global)
./scripts/mcp.sh --fix --no-test --local  # Configure in project settings

# Individual server installation
./scripts/setup.sh serena-only  # Install Serena MCP in user settings
./scripts/setup-serena.sh       # Direct Serena installation
```

#### MCP Configuration Scope
- **User Scope (Default)**: MCP servers are configured globally in Claude Code user settings
  - Available across all projects and workspaces
  - Settings persist between Claude Code sessions
  - Use `--user` flag or default behavior
- **Local Scope**: MCP servers configured for specific project
  - Only available in current project/workspace
  - Use `--local` flag explicitly

#### Troubleshooting MCP Connections
If MCP servers show "Failed to connect":
1. Run `./scripts/setup.sh mcp-fix` to automatically fix connections in user settings
2. Or use `./scripts/mcp.sh --fix --no-test --user` directly
3. This will:
   - Remove all existing MCP configurations
   - Configure servers in user scope (globally)
   - Servers are configured but not executed during setup
   - Test connections manually with: `claude mcp list`

The adaptive MCP setup intelligently detects MCP server installations:
- Environment variable overrides (MCP_*_PATH)
- Executables in PATH
- npm global installations
- Homebrew installations
- Local npm installations
- Falls back to npx for dynamic installation
